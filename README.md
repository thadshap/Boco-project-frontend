# BOCO - A rental site for everyone 

## Description
The BOCO Rental Project's purpose is to provide a solution for the increasing demand for distributed systems supporting <br> 
rental of items between members of the public. The goal of BOCO is to safely allow those who wish to lend items the means <br> 
to do so using a regulated platform meant for it; as well as to make lending easy for those who need or wish to do so. <br>
Hopefully, the solution might simultaneously help the environment in providing an easy way out for having to buy new <br>
items of necessity when the situation sees it fit.

### Who the application is for (main target audience)
This application is for anyone who is interested or in need of a platform where renting is used as a solution, instead of buying. <br>
The application is currently only existing in norwegian, but future releases are planned to hold other languages as well. 

<br>

### Database relation-model 
![img_1.png](src/main/resources/images/UML.png)

<br> 

### Technologies
The BOCO Rental Project uses:
- The Vue.js Framework at Frontend
- SpringBoot to provide the backend.
- JWT - Authentication for REST APIs
- MySQL - PHPMyAdmin holds the database. 
- H2 Database Engine - In-memory database for testing
- Swagger - API documentation
- Bootstrap / Bootstrap Studio - UI design
Swagger documentation is available at **localhost:8443/swagger-ui/**

<br>

###Application layout (structure)
![img.png](src/main/resources/images/applicationLayout.png)

This application implements REST API using the layered architectural style to organize our system of code. <br>
The layered architectural-style enforces strong Separations of Concerns, which aids in: 
- Providing a consistent pattern for our application's organization (structure)
- Code readability, as code-composition is enhanced, because each layer and class deals with a single task.
- Easier modifications due to how individual each layer is, minimally impacting other layers upon change.

**The database layer** is the model folder, which holds all the entities (tables) for the database. <br>

**The persistence layer** is the repository folder, which uses JpaRepository to provide an interface for br>
accessing the database and for performing ___CRUD___ operations. <br>

**The business layer** is the service folder, which implements the core logic of the application. Our service <br>
layer is abstracted through the use of individual interfaces for each service class. The point of this interface <br>
abstraction is to lower coupling between the service layer (business layer) and the controllers. <br>

**The presentation layer** is the controller folder, which has the responsibility to handle HTTP requests <br>
through the use of endpoints. The controllers forward the requests to the Service layer; and returns the results to clients. <br>
The controllers are the only classes that communicate with the frontend.

### Security 
When frontend and backend communicate (through the controllers), JWT-tokens are used to authenticate the user roles <br>
in the database. Passwords are encrypted and salted using BCrypt password encoder (part of Spring Security). <br>
The application also uses HTTPS instead of HTTP, actively enforcing security through the use of certificates.


### How to run and install the project backend
The technologies needed to run the commands are:
- Java version 11, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
- Maven, which can be downloaded [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), and installed using [these](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) instructions. <br>
- After that, type the following in a terminal or in a command prompt to verify the installation:


    mvn --version

To clone down the project, run the following command:

    git clone https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/hasanro/idatt2106_2022_05_backend.git

When the project has been cloned down, the pom.xml dependencies must be downloaded using the command:

    mvn dependency:resolve

After that, the package must be installed into the local repository, using the commmand:

    mvn install 

To run the application, one can choose between running through using the built-in IDE-button, or through using Maven:

    mvn spring-boot:run

<br>


### How to run and install the project frontend

The project frontend uses the Vue.js Framework. Before downloading Vue, one must have Node.js installed. <br>
Node.js installation can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Download the version that pertains to your operating system. <br>

Once the installer is downloaded:
- When prompted to run - click **run**.
- When welcomed by the wizard - click **next**.
- Review the license agreement and click **next** if you agree to the terms.
- The installer will prompt you for the installation location. Leave the default location, <br> unless you have a specific need to install it somewhere else – then click **next**.
- The wizard will let you select components to include or remove from the installation. <br> Choose your own desired modifications - then click **next**.
- Finally, click the **install** button to run the installer. When it finishes, click **Finish**.

Verify installation by writing into the terminal:

    node -v

Do the same for NPM:
    
    npm -v

Now that npm is installed, Vue.js can be downloaded through the use of the command:

    npm install vue

After installing Vue, the frontend project can be opened. <br>
To download all dependencies, run the command:

    npm install 

To serve up the application, run:
    
    npm run serve 

<br>

### Keys and Certificates

### How to use the application
The application is very intuitive in that it behaves the same way other applications do; 
using the same principles of Universal Design (UX).
- The user enters the login page and is prompted to either log in or register a new account. <br> The user may use Google or Facebook to register/log in if desired.
- Upon successful registration, the user is sent to the main page. <br> The user may choose to browse existing ads, or to create own ads if they wish to rent out items. 
- If the user wishes to browse, they may sort items based on category, price, and descending/ascending order. 
- If the user wished to rent an item, they can choose a span of available dates in the ad's calendar. <br> The rental is not immediate, because the owner of the item is prompted to accept the request (sent through email) before the user may borrow it. <br> Details regarding price-discussion, delivery/pick-up of the item is determined by the two parts (owner and borrower) through the use of the chat. 
- If the user wishes to chat with an arbitrary amount of people, they may do so through the use of groups. <br> Groups use WebSocket as a medium. 


### Dummy data

The application database already contains categories and dummy-data (ads, rentals, users), which are free to use. <br>
A dummy user for anyone to use when logging in is:


Username: ___andetel@stud.ntnu.no___ <br>
Password: ___passord123___


### Tests
The project contains 87 (currently) backend tests, which are runnable through the use of the terminal command:

    mvn run test

The frontend tests can be run through the use of the terminal command:
    
    npm run test:unit

Both projects use GitLab as its version control system.

<br>

### CI/CD
The frontend and backend both contain their own ".gitlab-ci.yml" file. <br> The files' purpose is to control Continous Integration for the projects, 
which controls the <br> pipeline holding all jobs necessary for GitLab to run upon a developers push to main. <br>

The backend pipeline consists of the stages:
- build
- verify
- test
- pages

The frontend pipeline consists of the stages:
- build
- test

### Future work
The project has been challenging, but rewarding. It was known from the beginning that the 3 weeks spent in finishing the <br>
project would never be enough to supply the project with all the desired features. Therefore, the list of future <br>
improvements is long and detailed. 

- In the future, it would be preferable to update the application such that a user can choose between different languages. <br> The current version only supports norwegian.
- In the future, unit types (currencies) must be implemented in backend for the Ad-model (to correspond with language updates).
- When updating postal code or street address for an ad, there should be a registry checkup (norwegian registry of postal addresses) <br> to see if the address exists before the user is allowed to post an ad.
- A waiting list entity to hold borrowers in queue when more than one borrower wished to borrow an object <br> at the same date (or overlapping the same dates). This would be of great use in the event that a borrower cancels their rental (within 24 hours), <br> such that potential borrowers in queue could receive a notification by email telling them the item is available.
- A smoother way to store images in the database would be considerably helpful in saving time when fetching <br> and rendering ads from the backend to the frontend.
- All ads have a rental time of 1 year. This means that 1 year at a time is saved for each ad in the backend. <br> After that, they are deleted. This means that future functionality would be to notify the user that they have to renew their ad when it's been up for <br> ca. 11 months (like with Finn, where ads are up for 2 months at a time). 
- Currently, users can create chat groups. A future implementation could extend this functionality into more <br> of a social network, where users can follow each other.
- Possibility to report other users for indecent behaviour, scams, being bots etc.
- Remove input checks in all methods in backend because verification happens through JWT. This would make the backend faster. <br> More accurately, this would mean to remove all checks for optional-objects when fetching elements by id from JPA-repositories.
- Search methods now use “contains()” in order to search. This is inefficient and slow. <br> Future work is to implement this in a way that would make the search function faster.
- Extend ad-model, which now includes the attribute duration type, to also include durationAmount <br> (max amount of lending time) if the owner wishes to use the feature when establishing or editing an ad.
- Functionality to edit an ad in frontend.
